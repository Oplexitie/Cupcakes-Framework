# Cupcakes Framework

A FNAF framework made for Godot 3. There are currently no plans to port this to Godot 4.

This framework only contains the very basic nescessities to build your FNAF inspired game.
As such I will not be adding any features that are :
  - A - Very easy to make on your own
  - B - Not necessary for a FNAF fan game

## Features

- Office
	- A simple scrolling system where the speed is based on how close your mouse is to the screens edge.
	- An equirectangular perspective shader ( like the one seen in FNAC )
- Camera System
	- A simple camera system that can be easily expanded to include more rooms
  - A flip up and down camera animation that won't break when spammed !
  - Camera movement ( like in FNAF 1 )
  - Support for smaller cameras while still supporting camera movement ( thanks to Godot's image region system )
  - Support for animated images on the camera ( no examples provided but I know you can do it easily )
- Character AI ( no Jumpscares )
  - AI system faithful to the original FNAF games
  - AI difficutly based on a scale from 0 to 20 ( basically Custom Night )
  - Custom character states for alternate poses on Cameras
