## Description

A Five Nights at Freddy's ( or FNAF ) framework made for Godot 4, with a [Godot 3 version also available](https://github.com/Oplexitie/Cupcakes-Framework/tree/godot3).

This framework only contains the very basic nescessities to build your FNAF inspired game.
As such I will not be adding any features that are :
  - A - Very easy to make on your own
  - B - Not necessary for a FNAF like game

Also, there's the [CF-Example-Project](https://github.com/Oplexitie/CF-Example-Project/tree/main) (**made in the Godot 3**) that was made using this framework that can be used as a reference.

## Features

- Office
	- A simple scrolling system where the speed is based on how close your mouse is to the screens edge.
	- An equirectangular perspective shader ( like the one seen in [Five Nights at Candy's Remastered](https://gamejolt.com/games/five-nights-at-candy-s-remastered/426659) )
- Camera System
	- A simple camera system that can be easily expanded to include more rooms
  - A flip up and down camera animation that won't break when spammed !
  - Camera movement ( like in FNAF 1 )
  - Support for smaller cameras while still supporting camera movement ( thanks to Godot's image region system )
  - Support for animated images on the camera ( via the AnimationPlayer node )
- Character AI ( no Jumpscares )
  - AI system faithful to the original FNAF games
  - AI difficutly based on a scale from 0 to 20 ( basically Custom Night )
  - Custom character states for alternate poses on Cameras
