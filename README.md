</p>

A Five Nights at Freddy's (or FNAF) framework made for Godot 4, with a [Godot 3 version also available](https://github.com/Oplexitie/Cupcakes-Framework/tree/godot3).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This framework only contains the very basic necessities to build your FNAF inspired game.
>As such, I will not be adding any features that :
>  - A - Are very easy to make on your own
>  - B - Are not necessary for a FNAF like game
>  - C - Make the project a convoluted mess

## Features

- Office
  - A simple scrolling system where the speed is based on how close your mouse is to the screens edge
  - An equirectangular perspective shader (like the one seen in [Five Nights at Candy's Remastered](https://gamejolt.com/games/five-nights-at-candy-s-remastered/426659))
- Camera System
  - A simple camera system that can be easily expanded to include more rooms
  - Camera movement (like in FNAF 1)
- Character AI (No Jumpscares)
  - AI system faithful to the original FNAF games with difficulty scaled from 0 to 20 (for Custom Night)
  - Support for custom character states for alternate poses on Cameras
